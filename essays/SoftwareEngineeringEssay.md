Did you ever wonder how abstract code can turn into a very organized application that everyone uses on a daily basis? Well, that is what sparked my interest in software engineering. I've always dreamt of creating software that helps people with certain tasks, or just software that does things for you (like AI). I have barely dealt with super-abstract code, so this will be a new learning experience for me.

The technical skills that I aim to develop further is to be proficient in what this ICS314 class has to offer (Typescript mainly). Being able to code in most programming languages would be beneficial for me in the work force, as a lot of jobs require that you know how to code using most programming languages. Getting a job in the tech field requires a lot of patience and learning.

In taking this class, I strive to improve my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. These skills will help me in the future, especially in the workforce. Being able to communicate with others, work in groups, and solving big problems is a really great skill to have. In the future, I hope to work for a big tech company.
