## Need help? Ask questions the right way!

Have you ever been stuck on something related to your code and wanted a concrete solution to that to your specific problem in a detailed manner? That's when StackOverflow comes and saves the day! It has never been easier to ask questions about problems with your code. According to a statistic I found online, as of March 2024, Stack Overflow has over 23 million registered users, and has received over 24 million questions and 35 million answers. Now, in an essay called "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond, he discusses how there are questions that are deemed as "good" and questions that are deemed as "bad". Good questions on StackOverflow are basically questions that are asked WITH a detailed explanation of your problem and what you tried to do to fix it (which ended up not working, obviously). Bad questions, on the other hand, are questions asked with pasted code in the textbox AND not much explanation to the problem whatsoever.

## A good question!

Here is an example of a [good question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim). I honestly think that this is considered a "good" question because the user that submitted the question included that they have tried to exit vim with "type :quit<Enter> to quit VIM", but said it just "simply appears in the object body". The user has attempted to solve the problem, and due to them not being able to solve it themselves, they asked their question on StackOverflow. An example of a "bad" version of this question is "How to exit vim" with no text in the body (just the question)!

## A bad question!

Here is an example of a [bad question]
